</p>

EyvalonMoons was created with the open source WebBrowser GameEngine
[New-Star - github.com/Yaro2709/New-Star](https://github.com/Yaro2709/New-Star)</br>
and is based on the the open source browsergame
[2Moons - github.com/jkroepke/2Moons](https://github.com/jkroepke/2Moons). 

The browsergame is for the Eyvalon Community purposes. The opportunity was given to change the game code by the Eyvaloniers as a contribution to New-Star/2Moons.
There are many things to modify starting from **graphics, languages, code improvements up to EyvalonGames integration and bughunting**.
